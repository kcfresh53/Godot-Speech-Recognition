# Godot Speech Recognition
 Uses C# to allow speech recognition in godot
 
 The project was a test to see if speech recognition in godot was possible. I ran into issues when creating a plugin for every 3.x version of godot so I am making it opensource for anyone to use.
 
 
 To improve the speed of the speech recognition you can edit the Hello.gram file to add keywords and enable the keywords use of keywords in code.
 
 If you are copying the files to another project, make sure to create a new audio bus and add the "Record" effect to it. Also enable microphone inputs in your projects.
 
 I hope this helps anyone who may want to implement speech recognition in their projects. Thank you.
